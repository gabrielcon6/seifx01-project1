X || O (Tic Tac Toe) Rules

• The board is a matrix of three rows by three columns.

• Two players each choose one symbol to represent them, usually a circle (O) or a cross (X).

• Players alternate turns, by selecting an empty square to place their symbol.

• The goal is to get three circles or three crosses in a row (either horizontally, vertically or diagonally) while attempting to prevent their opponent from achieving 3 in a row.

• When a player achieves the goal, the scoreboard is updated.

 

Points system:

·      If you win the fastest way possible (with only 3 symbols down), you get 4 points. The other player loses 2 points.

·      If you win with 4 symbols down, you get 3 points, the other player minus one.

·      If you win on the last round (5 symbols down), you get 2 points, the other player does not lose any.

·      If it is a tie, both players get 1 point each.

·      The first player to get to 10 points in total is the winner of the game.

 

Have fun!
